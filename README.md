Hi, everyone!

We're excited to announce that our first event on the conference will be a presentation on Minded AI!

What is Minded AI? It's a short form of minded artificial intelligence which is working on and paying efforts to improve the lives of people with the latest AI Technology. We are going to develop a system called "Minded AI," which will use AI technology to help people to make their lives more developed and to make their social interactions more convenient. We will also develop an app called "Minded AI Me." This app will help people to make their smart AI home technology controlled more conveniently.

We are proud to set organizations like Lanches Machine, because we know that these technologies can make a huge difference in the lives of people. Join us on Tuesday, July 11th from 7pm-9pm in Lanches Park (2nd floor, 3rd block), where we'll be hosting this presentation on Minded AI, by Lanches Machine!
